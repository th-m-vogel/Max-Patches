# DESCRIPTION:

Nothing here to rely on. Ideas, POC, poking around in max objects for fun. Expect fast changes, expect things to appear or disappear, no intended maintenance, things may break (or break your Ableton).

Sometimes, things starting here, may become a usable M4L device.

If you like, poke around, comment suggest - whatever.

# Remarks

Enjoy ... make music ... Use at your own risk ... in this category the risk is probably very high.
