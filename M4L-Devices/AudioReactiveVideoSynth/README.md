# WARNING

Using this M4L device on Ableton Live 11 using the embedded Max8 Version (8.5.6) will probaly crash you Ableton. Also, the Skybox Feature will not work here.
Upadte Max to use this device! This device was developed and tested using Ableton Live 11 and Max8 8.6.2.

This M4L device is heavy! It may eat a lot of cpu, it uses GPU. This is especialy so if you use it for the 1st time. It is probably not posible to have it running in an already cpu expensive live set. 

## My System

Deleopment and testing is done using Windows 11, Ableton 11 Suite (latest update), Max8 (latest update), Ableton is configured to NOT use the bundled Max version (Ableton Preference, Folders).

# Custome Skyboxes

You can drop a Cubemap on the VCR preview in the device. For Space cubemaps you may want to visit - https://tools.wwwtyro.net/space-3d/index.html - the skybox included with the plugin is a 1k skybox from tyro. 1st release version included 2k skyboxes - that's somewhat heavy. Keep in mind, a 1k skybox is already a 4k by 3k png file.
