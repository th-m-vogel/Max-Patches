## DESCRIPTION:

Something polyrhythmic, semi generative - ish ... sequencing ... You have 16 (or less) running on different phase and phase shift to create notes from a defined scale.

In fact, i wanted to do something in the direction of the YT-er Lucid Rythm and took this as a reason to dip in to Max ... So, my 1st M4L device.

want to have a look at it running? - https://youtu.be/H_1-QaDhjWg

## UI Description

The device linked to Ableton Transport. Transport off stops the device fcrom running.

- On/Off switch: You can Start/Stop the device. When ON the Phase setings are locked.
- Sine / Rectified: changes Waveform for the oscilation from Sine to Full-Rectified-Sine. Will Result in different pattens, especialy over longer running time.
- Loop Length:cycle time per stage. When set to "free" the Loop Time dial "Loop (s)" gets unlocked
- Loop (s): cycle time per stage. only unlocked if Loop Length is set to "free"
- Phase: adusts the initial phase shift from stage to stage in %
- Fine: Fine adusts the initial phase shift from stage to stage in ‰
- Shift: Adjists the phase shift per stage, per cycle in ‰
- Steps: how many of the available 16 steps are active
- Reset: resets stages
- Bass Trigger Button: shows bass Trigger, can trigger bass manually
- Bass Trigger Loops: after how many cycles the bass will trigger

- The Multislider Box: Visualizes the state of the changes. ToDo - make this an  workin input device for the initial state. 

- Root: root note for the sequence
- Scale: scale to use for the sequence. If you select random / permute / neighbour thr <"Trig" button will scramble the Matrix
- Matrix: Visualisation of the scale to use. You can change this.
- Octave Offset: in waht octave is the lowest note (leftmost cycle) played

-Note Visualisatio: well, kust what is is ...

## ToDo

Fix identified quirks, find more and fix, Improve, learn more about Max

## Remarks

Use at your own risk ...
