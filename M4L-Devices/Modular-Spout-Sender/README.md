# DESCRIPTION:

The goal is to create a universal Spout-Sender, able to connect to any M4L deviice that is prepared zu use it. 

# Download M4L device

comming soon-ish .. so i hope

# ACTUAL STATE

It is an early stage development

- It is working for me
- integration in existing M4L devices is easy, just a little abstraction needs to be added
- My Bouncy-Drumpads device is already prepared to communicate with the AV-Recorder

# Abstraction for Visualisations

https://github.com/th-m-vogel/Max-Abstractions/blob/main/sev.VideoSender.maxpat

It is meant to be used as a bpatcher
Documentation needs to be done.

# Remarks

Enjoy ... make music ... Use at your own risk ...
